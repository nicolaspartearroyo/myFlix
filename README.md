# myFlix-server

<p>I built the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
application will provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>

<li>Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a
single movie by title to the user</li>
<li>Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)</li>
<li>Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name</li>
<li>Allow new users to register</li>
<li>Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)</li>
<li>Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites</li>
<li>Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites</li>
<li>Allow existing users to deregister</li>

<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<li>The API is a Node.js and Express application.</li>
<li>The API use REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data
operations listed above</li>
<li>The API use at least three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for
reading data from requests and morgan for logging.</li>
<li>The API use a “package.json” file.</li>
<li>The database is built using MongoDB.</li>
<li>The business logic is modeled with Mongoose.</li>
<li>The API provide movie information in JSON format.</li>
<li>The JavaScript code is error-free.</li>
<li>The API is tested in Postman.</li>
<li>The API include user authentication and authorization code.</li>
<li>The API include data validation logic.<l/i>
<li>The API meet data security regulations.</li>
<li>The API source code is deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub.</li>
<li>The API is deployed to Heroku</li>
